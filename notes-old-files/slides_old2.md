## The Challenge

<v-clicks>

- Documentation struggles to keep pace with rapid product evolution.  
- Siloed ownership → duplicated, outdated, or inconsistent information.  
- Writers act reactively, not strategically.  
- Users can’t easily find, trust, or act on information.  
- The business sees documentation as a cost center, not a growth driver.  

</v-clicks>

<!-- notes:
Set context — you’re reframing documentation from a reactive service to a proactive, strategic function.

## Vision & Guiding Principles

<v-clicks>

- **Docs as a product**: business-aligned, measurable, and evolving.  
- **User-centric**: focused on activation and self-serve success.  
- **Collaborative**: everyone contributes to the knowledge ecosystem.  
- **Continuous**: content lifecycle mirrors the product lifecycle.

<span class="text-blue-500">1️⃣ Break Silos</span>
<span class="opacity-40">2️⃣ Know the User</span>
<span class="opacity-40">3️⃣ Measure</span>
<span class="opacity-40">4️⃣ Process</span>
<span class="opacity-40">5️⃣ Shift Left</span>
</div>

## Step 1: Break the Silos

<v-clicks>

- Form a **cross-functional content committee**: Marketing, Product Marketing, Tech Writing, Engineering, Support, Sales, Content Design.  
- Align on **shared goals and touchpoints** where users encounter content.  
- Ensure **progressive disclosure** — each piece builds on the previous.  
- Treat knowledge as an orchestrated product experience.

<span class="opacity-40">4️⃣ Process</span>
<span class="opacity-40">5️⃣ Shift Left</span>
</div>

## Step 2: Know the User

<v-clicks>

- Partner with **UX Research** and **Product Design** to map core workflows (Ingest, Observe, Secure, Deliver).  
- Conduct **journey mapping** to reveal mindset and content needs per stage.  
- Define **content deliverables per step** — guide discovery → adoption → mastery.  
- Create **proficiency levels** for each flow (entry → advanced).

<span class="opacity-40">5️⃣ Shift Left</span>

## Step 3: Measure What Matters

<v-clicks>

- Shift from **content engagement → behavior change**.  
- Ask: “Did users succeed after engaging?” not “Did they click it?”  
- Track **coverage of workflows** and **movement along journeys**.  
- Tie metrics to **business outcomes** — adoption, self-serve rate, support deflection.

## Step 4: Define Process

<v-clicks>

- Establish **clear ownership** across roles and content tiers.  
- Implement **tiered documentation standards** — clarity on what to produce per release.  
- Align with Product on **“Definition of Ready” / “Definition of Done.”**  
- Standardize hand-offs → fewer last-minute scrambles.

## Step 5: Shift-Left Knowledge

<v-clicks>

- Identify **information needs earlier** in the product cycle.  
- Embed knowledge creation in **design and development phases.**  
- Foster **shared ownership** — everyone produces and maintains knowledge.  
- Enable teams with templates, standards, and guidance.  
- Long-term: more robust, learnable products.

## Measuring Impact

<v-clicks>

- **Primary KPIs**  
  - % of high-impact workflows with complete coverage  
  - Reduction in support tickets per feature  
  - Increase in feature adoption / time-to-value  
- **Supporting metrics**  
  - Staleness rate  
  - Content reuse ratio  
  - Contributor satisfaction  

</v-clicks>

## Next Steps

<v-clicks>

1. Launch the **cross-functional content committee.**  
2. Map and prioritize **core user workflows.**  
3. Pilot the new process with one workflow.  
4. Define metrics → measure → iterate.
