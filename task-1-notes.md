Dynatrace relies on docs to:

- Drive customer adoption
- Ensure self sufficiency

## Assumptions

- Access to other departments, willingness to collaborate, and ability to influence their roadmap
- Not only a docs problem, but a general problem with feature adoption, self-serve, and information discovery
- Documentation lack of success comes from 2 main issue categories:
  - Relevance: the information is not answering the user question and is not updated, or not provided in the right context
  - Usability: isn't pleasant to use and not packaged following the user's mental model
  - Findability: the information is not easy to find or not provided in the most effective format
- All the steps in the presentation are cyclic. There's no do-once-and-forget task, everything is done again periodically to evaluate quality, results, and pivot if needed.

## A holistic approach to the learning journey

"It's like the folk at Dynatrace can read my mind: they know what information I need, when I need it, and the best way to feed it to me."

Learning doesn't happen in silos, users don't live their relationship with a product as a mix of distinct business functions (Marketing, Engineering, Design, etc). They live a product as a cohesive unit. A person's ability to learn depends on the synergy between multiple elements: motivation, focus, time, energy.

An effective knowledge department accounts for such elements and is able to break silos and provide a holistic learning experience.

## Step 1: Break the silos

Create a committee of all the teams who take an active part in creating content about a feature (Marketing, Product Marketing, Tech Writing, Engineering, Support, Sales, Content Design).

Each "department" brings expertise about their content deliverables. The main goal is to create a shared understanding of the various touch points where users get in contact with the information produced by and about the product.

What matters here is orchestration. All the deliverables must talk to each other. There's gotta be progressive disclosure, taking the user from the beginning to the end of their journey.

Content can be upsold just as a product can. Just as a product, upselling requires that the user is in the right mindset, so the upselling timing is crucial.

## Step 2: Know the user

1. Partner with UX research and product design to create a mapping of the core workflows (Ingest, Observe, Secure, Deliver).
2. For each workflow, do a customer journey map exercise. It's important to understand the user's mindset at each step of the journey, with the goal of creating a shared understanding of what type of content is relevant at each step.
3. With the committee, define the set of content deliverables for each step.

Bonus point: create proficiency levels per user flow: "An entry-level user can do X", "A mid-level user can do Y", "An advanced user can do Z".

The idea is that teams start to think in terms of user journeys and gain increased awareness of when it's the right time to surface a certain piece of information.

The committee will meet regularly also to experiment with content and iterate on it as needed. Its role is to generate another feedback loop. They all become a voice of the user in their relative journey step. So that someone can get to the committee and say "I noticed a user having pain point X during the time I spent with them, what's the best way to help them?".

## Step 3: Measure what matters

North stars: drive activation and self-serve, not docs engagement

Focus on driving the behavior change: Stop asking "Did the user engage with this content?" and start asking "Did the user do X after engaging with this content?"

Map this to business outcomes: what features are the most impactful? What are the criteria to decide what's impactful? Is it revenue? Is it user adoption?

Of course one would measure coverage of the core workflows, but also movement between the journey steps.

Traditional content metrics still matter, but their role is now to support the main metrics.

No longer measured on tickets closed: Team releases feature, person publishes docs, but on outcome. Implement a system

to evaluate whether it changes ways users 

## Step 4: Define process

Once the standard set of content deliverables is defined and owners are identified, it's time for process. Defining clear owners is important also to declutter the scope of the docs team.

The committee can also influence product and the definition of ready and definitions of done for an increment. If the goal is to increase output efficiency and quality, the only way is to improve the quality and efficiency of the input.

Information what information needs to be generated by product so that all the teams are enabled to work on their deliverables. As with everything, the devil is in the details, and if all the architecture and business decisions, business logic, limitations, and so on can be discussed (and challenged) earlier.

Tiered approach: Define a standard set of documentation to be produced per tier, so that when a tier is assigned, workflows are automatically triggered.
The tiering system can also serve as a content prioritization framework.

## Step 5: Shift-left knowledge

By assessing and identifying information needs earlier on, all the content operations can get closer to the earlier stages of the product development cycle. All the operations can be triggered earlier on, so that everyone has the right context to work on their deliverables and more time to spot and prevent issues.

At the same time, this shift wants to foster a sense of shared ownership of knowledge, both internally and externally, where everyone is equipped and empowered to produce the content they need. My client is whoever requires information from me. For example, Customer-facing teams are clients of the product/engineering team, the user is the client of customer-facing teams. Customer-facing teams are clients of the knowledge team from an operational perspective because they need the knowledge team to produce standards, templates, and guidance on how to produce good content.

Part of the roles of the committee is also to identify what pieces of information need to be produced during the product development cycle so that everyone can do their job properly.

 This approach has the indirect long-term benefit of making the product more robust as teams learn to consider the multi-disciplinary perspective from the conception (troubleshooting, usability, learnability).

At the same time, the committee can influence product by making the workflows and the journey mappings a formal tool through which increments are interpreted. Every increment is assessed against the journeys and interpreted as a delta to how users complete a certain JTBD. This would work similarly to GIT, where every commit is a delta to the previous commit, regardless of what type of "CRUD" operation it is.

This new perspective can also help visualize overlaps an upsell opportunities.

Docs are everyone's responsibility: PMs have 3 clients: Business, Users, but also stakeholders, so they gotta make sure
