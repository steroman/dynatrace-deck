Ok so, before we dive deeper there's some due diligence to do. Here are the assumptions I have made along the way. So please start from them to frame the scope of this proposal. Should one not hold, any level can be adapted: from strategy to execution.

The strategy requires a mix of change management, content operations, and product management. In the real world, this would be handled by a larger team with cross-functional expertise.

<!-- notes:
When introducing this slide, I’ll frame the idea as solving one of our biggest systemic gaps — the lack of shared awareness across teams that all produce user-facing content. 

Right now, each function — marketing, product marketing, documentation, support, sales, engineering — produces information in isolation. Everyone’s contributing to the story, but no one is orchestrating the full experience from the user’s point of view. 

So I plan on starting by creating a cross-functional team that brings together all these user-facing roles — not as a committee that meets for the sake of meetings, but as a working group that builds shared ownership of knowledge. The vision is collaboration as a means to shared responsibility: everyone who shapes information should understand what others need to serve users effectively.

This team’s mission is threefold. First, to define a standard set of content that must exist for every user journey — what needs to be produced, by whom, and at what stage. Second, to map those content pieces against the actual user journey, ensuring each deliverable moves users naturally from one step to the next. This includes thinking about the user’s emotional state, prior knowledge, and receptivity — not just where they are in the product, but how ready they are to absorb new information. 

Third, the team will own feedback loops: they’ll bring insights from their respective departments back into the group, share patterns, and experiment with improvements. It’s not a static council — it’s a lab for content innovation. The goal is to continually test and refine how our content performs, whether that’s by changing the format, timing, or even the purpose of a deliverable.

Over time, this team will also create awareness of what information needs to be produced earlier in the product lifecycle. That’s how we’ll shift knowledge left — identifying gaps before release, not after. They’ll influence definitions of ready and done, align content tiering, and eventually coordinate releases and shared metrics across teams.

To make this successful, I’ll start small. Leadership endorsement is key, but equally important is momentum — so I’ll pilot this with a smaller, less rigid product area where teams are open to experimentation. Once we show clear wins — better coordination, fresher content, fewer support escalations — we’ll expand. 

I’ll tell the story here about a time when a customer-facing team couldn’t find the right material during a product launch, leading to confusion and inconsistent messaging. Then I’ll describe how this cross-functional setup would have prevented that by ensuring everyone had visibility, earlier context, and a shared definition of “ready.” It makes the problem tangible and the solution obvious.

2. <strong>Define Deliverables per Stage and Release Tier</strong>  
   - Identify the <strong>content required</strong> at each step of the journey.  
   - Decide with Product which deliverables are produced or maintained for each release tier:  
     - <strong>Tier 1:</strong> Full set of deliverables (PR, blog posts, newsletters, release notes, help center articles, changelog, troubleshooting guides, etc.)  
     - <strong>Tier 2:</strong> Essential subset of deliverables.

3. <strong>Test Content in Context</strong>  
   - Validate content <strong>within the workflow</strong>, not as stand-alone assets, to ensure relevance and usability.

4. <strong>Assess Each Increment</strong>  
   - Evaluate every new piece of content as a <strong>delta from the current journey mapping</strong>.  
   - This ensures continuous improvement and alignment with actual user needs.

<!-- notes:
Traditional content teams often measure success through engagement and clarity. These matter, but if we stop there, we miss the real reason content exists: to influence behavior and drive business outcomes. Users don’t want to “engage” with content — they want answers, they want to solve problems, and they want to move on with their day. So we need to measure content in terms of what it helps them accomplish.

Once we have journey mapping in place, we can define clear behavioral goals for each stage. At awareness, users need to understand what a feature is and why it matters. At exploration, they need enough guidance to understand how it works. At activation, they need a clear path to success. And not every feature requires the same depth — and that’s fine. What matters is that we assess these stages systematically and build loops to learn and iterate.

On the user side, we measure things like activation time, task completion without support, and troubleshooting confidence. These tell us whether content is helping users perform the jobs-to-be-done and reduce friction.

On the business side, we focus on metrics like feature discovery and adoption uplift, and reductions in support tickets, especially “how do I…” questions. If the organization uses AI agents trained on the docs, we can also measure deflection or containment — essentially, whether the content is strong enough for the AI to answer without escalating to support.

Finally, on the operational side, we continue tracking how efficiently we work: time from roadmap changes to published content, review cycles, and how well teams follow content standards. These operational metrics help us identify friction and improve the content delivery system itself — something we’ll explore more in the next section.

<!--
When we talk about process, the goal isn’t bureaucracy — it’s scalability, predictability, and the ability to measure what matters. Standards don't only improve efficiency and consistency, but they also allow to measure deviations from them. A scalable process gives us that clarity.

There isn't one single “content process.” Instead, it’s a combination of systems working together.

The first system is automation: using journey mapping and content tiering to automatically identify what needs to be produced at each product increment. If something enters the roadmap or changes state, that should trigger content work. With the right metadata and forms around work items, writers should receive the information they need upfront rather than having to chase PMs and SMEs for context. This eliminates information-hunting and creates a predictable flow.

But the organic interactions matter too — hallway conversations, early signals from design reviews, Slack threads, support insights. These informal pathways reveal real user needs. A good governance model accounts for both the automated and the organic workstreams and provides tools to track them and turn them into actionable and measurable tasks.

Next, we think about content lifecycle. I prefer a “git-like” model: every change to the product creates a delta in content. That approach naturally reduces staleness because the content system mirrors the product system. I've seen teams rely on periodic staleness checks — for example, flagging articles that haven’t been touched in six months. That can work, but it often incentivizes quick edits rather than meaningful reevaluation. A delta-based model prevents this by design. You can even go further with ideas like docs-as-tests, where documentation is backed by automated end-to-end tests — if the tests fail, the content is outdated.

Ownership and accountability play a huge role. Writers need influence over the Definition of Ready and Definition of Done to make sure content requirements are baked into product milestones, not treated as an afterthought.

A scalable process also means considering all workstreams: reactive updates, roadmap-driven projects, experiments, maintenance, and innovation. And it means balancing day-to-day delivery with long-term strategic work.

Finally, process is how we turn north-star outcomes into actionable work. Whether you use OKRs, GIST, RICE, or an evidence-scoring model, the important thing is building a culture of experimentation and frequent reassessment. We should routinely evaluate how content performs: which articles are succeeding, which are failing, and why. This constant loop of evidence and iteration is how the system becomes self-improving.

The end goal isn’t a rigid workflow — it’s a living, adaptive system that mirrors the product, scales with the organization, and improves based on evidence.

</div>

</div>

<!-- notes:
Shifting content left is ultimately a culture change. The term comes from software testing, where teams started moving tests earlier in the development cycle to catch issues sooner, reduce costs, and improve quality. We're applying the same principle to knowledge work.

Everything we’ve talked about so far — cross-functional collaboration, journey mapping, behavior-based measurement, automation, governance — all of it adds up to shifting knowledge earlier in the lifecycle. When content is considered only at the end, we create churn, we create rework, and we limit our ability to influence the product experience. When content is considered from the beginning, it becomes part of how the product is designed, validated, and delivered.

Shifting left means that information needs are surfaced early, before development starts. It means that gathering inputs isn’t an ad-hoc scramble at the end, but a natural part of how teams collaborate. It means that contributors across product, design, engineering, and support understand the role they play in maintaining and evolving the knowledge base. Writers stop being information hunters and become strategic partners.

This shift only works when the system supports it: clear standards, repeatable templates, metadata that captures the right information, and tooling that makes it easy for anyone to contribute. When those pieces are in place, ownership becomes shared, content quality improves, and teams make better decisions because the narrative is present from the beginning.

So shifting content left isn’t a single initiative — it’s the natural outcome of building the right team, mapping the journey, measuring the right things, and creating a scalable, evidence-based process. It’s how content becomes a true part of the product, rather than an afterthought.

<!--
When we talk about next steps, the priority is to make this framework real in a way that’s simple, actionable, and low-friction.

The first step is to define success. Before we do anything, we align on what “good” looks like: the outcomes we want to drive, who owns what, and the metrics that will tell us whether we’re moving in the right direction. This gives everyone the same north star.

Next, we enable contributors. None of this works unless people feel equipped to participate. That means lightweight training, clear standards, and simple templates so teams know what’s expected and can contribute without friction. This is where the culture shift starts.

Then we run a small pilot — just one product area. We map one end-to-end user workflow, apply the tiering and governance model, and test how the process holds up in real life. The goal is not perfection, but learning.

To reinforce momentum, we make progress visible. A transparent metrics dashboard helps show early impact, build trust, and create advocates across teams.

Finally, after three months, we review results, refine the model, and scale. This approach keeps the scope controlled, the risk low, and the learning high — and it ensures that when we expand, we do it with confidence and evidence, not assumptions.

# Part 2  
## Modernizing the content lifecycle

<!-- notes:
In Task 1 we explored a strategic and user-centered approach to documentation. 
Now, Task 2 zooms into the operational backbone that makes all of that possible: 
a modern, scalable content lifecycle.
The problem we’re addressing is that writers can’t keep up with the pace of product change. 
Content becomes stale, users lose trust, support carries unnecessary load, and LLM-powered features 
start returning outdated or misleading information.
So in this section, I’ll walk you through how I would evaluate the current lifecycle, identify opportunities, 
and define a practical but powerful transition plan.

# Mission  
## Velocity and quality at scale

<!-- notes:
The mission behind modernizing the lifecycle is not simply “fix documentation.”
It’s to build a system that simultaneously delivers velocity and quality — sustainably.

In an ideal world, writers spend most of their time writing. 
But today, much of their time gets absorbed by chasing inputs, 
answering ad-hoc questions, compensating for unclear processes, or filling gaps left upstream.

A modern lifecycle reduces friction at every stage. 
It protects the focus of writers, gives PMs clarity about what’s expected from them, 
and ensures documentation keeps up with product velocity.

Everything in this proposal ladders up to this mission: 
creating a system that enables high-quality content, fast, and without burnout.

# Our operating assumptions

**Velocity =** less friction · better tooling · solid processes  
**Quality =** clarity · relevance · governance · strong inputs  
**Scalability =** repeatable standards · automation · shared ownership  
**Sustainability =** balanced workloads · clear roles · predictable flow

<!-- notes:
These are the assumptions that guide every decision in the lifecycle.

Velocity isn’t created by pushing people harder — it’s created by removing friction, 
reducing noise, and giving teams the right tooling and clear processes.

Quality depends on good inputs: clear context, accurate information, and well-defined roles. 
Strong governance ensures quality doesn’t degrade over time.

Scalability comes from standardization: templates, guidelines, automation, and reuse. 
We can’t scale through heroics; we scale through systems.

And sustainability is crucial. If workloads aren’t balanced, or roles aren’t clear, 
the entire lifecycle breaks under pressure.

These assumptions shape everything I recommend next.

# What success looks like

> “Documentation is predictable, scalable, and aligned with business outcomes.”  
<small>— Leadership</small>

> “I finally spend most of my time writing.”  
<small>— Writer</small>

> “I know exactly what’s expected of me and how to contribute.”  
<small>— PM</small>

<!-- notes:
Here’s what success looks like once the lifecycle is modernized.

Leadership feels confident: documentation becomes predictable, scalable, 
and aligned with what the business needs — not just a downstream afterthought.

Writers feel protected: they finally spend most of their time writing, 
instead of fighting noise or unclear expectations.

And PMs feel empowered: they know exactly what the docs team needs, 
and they know how to contribute effectively without guesswork.

These quotes represent the cultural shift we aim to create — 
and they define our target state.

# The path forward

**1. Evaluate the system**  
**2. Audit scope**  
**3. Prioritize what matters**  
**4. Allocate time deliberately**  
**5. Strengthen operations**  
**6. Measure performance**  
**7. Start small**

<!-- notes:
Here’s the roadmap for how we get from where we are now 
to a modern content lifecycle.

We start by evaluating how work flows today. 
Then we audit the scope of what we actually produce. 
We bring clarity by introducing a prioritization model. 
We allocate time deliberately so writers can balance feature work and improvements.
We strengthen the operational backbone.
We measure performance so decisions become evidence-based.
And finally, we start small — test, refine, and scale intentionally.

I'll walk through each of these steps.

# Step 1  
## Evaluate the system

<!-- notes:
The first step is to evaluate the system — not with a huge needs assessment, 
but by understanding how work really flows.

I start with people: How much time do writers spend writing versus gathering information, 
answering Slack messages, or interpreting vague requests? 
Where do interruptions happen? What pulls them off-track?

Then process: What is the true workflow from feature planning to publishing? 
Where are handoffs unclear? How many parallel workstreams are competing for attention? 
Where does information get lost?

Technology: Do we have templates, metadata, automation, or linting 
that reduce rework and prevent errors? 
Where are writers compensating for missing tooling?

A crucial part of this step is centralizing all incoming work into a single board. 
Right now, work likely comes through Slack, Jira, ad-hoc conversations, support, and so on. 
When intake is fragmented, prioritization becomes impossible.

Finally, I analyze where content breaks the user journey. 
Where do users get lost? Where do support tickets spike? 
Those pain points tell us where the lifecycle is failing to deliver.

This evaluation creates the foundation for everything that follows.

# Step 2  
## Audit the scope

<!-- notes:
The second step is to audit the scope: what do we actually produce, 
and does all of it need to exist?

I begin by listing all content types, variants, and formats. 
Then I map each one to user needs and business goals.
Some content directly drives behavior change — onboarding flows, core workflows, troubleshooting. 
Other content has much lower impact.

By identifying high-impact vs low-impact categories, 
we can reduce unnecessary variants and focus our efforts.

This step also creates harmony with Task 1: 
content should support the user journey, not fight against it. 
The audit ensures everything we produce has a purpose.

Once we know the scope, prioritization becomes meaningful.

# Step 3  
## Prioritize what matters

<!-- notes:
A modern lifecycle needs a modern prioritization model.
I use a dual-track system.

For strategic improvements — revamps, experiments, restructuring — 
I use an evidence-based flow: 
North Star → OKRs → GIST → Confidence → ICE → prioritization.  
This ensures we focus on ideas with the highest potential impact and highest confidence.

For operational work — especially feature documentation — 
we use the tiering model from Task 1:
Tier 0 always gets done; Tier 1 gets done unless capacity is constrained; 
Tier 2 only happens when resources allow.

This dual system creates transparency and alignment. 
It helps PMs understand why something is prioritized or deprioritized, 
and it prevents the team from being pulled in every direction by urgent demands.

Knowing what to say “no” to is just as important as what we say “yes” to.

# Step 4  
## Allocate time deliberately

<!-- notes:
Balancing feature work, improvements, and experimentation 
requires intentional time allocation.

First, writers need support in learning how to estimate. 
We start with conservative estimates, run retros, and improve accuracy over time — 
just like engineering teams do.

Second, we define quotas. 
For example: a percentage of each writer’s capacity is dedicated to experimentation 
or lifecycle improvements. This prevents a situation where all we ever do is ship feature docs.

Third, we align with leadership. 
PMs and engineering managers need to understand that experimentation 
is not a luxury — it’s how we prevent long-term content debt and keep quality high.

Finally, training plays a key role. 
When contributors understand templates, workflows, and expectations, 
the entire lifecycle becomes smoother and less reactive.

Deliberate allocation protects teams from overload 
and ensures we move both fast and smart.

# Step 5  
## Strengthen operations

<!-- notes:
This is the backbone of the lifecycle — the operational engine behind quality and scale.

We begin with clear content guidelines and templates 
so that writers don’t reinvent the wheel each time.

We improve reuse by identifying when content can be consolidated or modularized. 
This drastically reduces maintenance burden.

We invest in tooling: 
automated linting via Vale or remark, 
standardized screenshot naming, 
scripts that apply formatting rules across the repo, 
and snippet libraries or DWK to accelerate writing tasks.

We explore more advanced tools like RAG-based autocomplete,
which pulls definitions and code references from a single source of truth 
so content stays consistent.

Next, contribution guidelines. 
PMs, engineers, and designers must know exactly what information to provide, 
in what format, and at what time.

We define approval SLAs so content doesn’t sit idle, 
and engineering allocates a percentage of sprint time 
to supporting documentation requirements.

Governance ties it all together: 
periodic QA, flow-adherence reviews, 
roadmap-driven deprecation, 
and dashboards that highlight trends and bottlenecks.

Strengthening operations reduces friction, improves quality, 
and frees writers to do what they do best.

# Step 6  
## Measure performance

<!-- notes:
Performance measurement ensures we make decisions based on evidence, not assumptions.

We evaluate across three lenses: users, business, and operations.

For users: 
task completion, feature adoption, time to value, onboarding friction, troubleshooting success.
We also consider readability, comprehension tests, and feedback from support and the community.

For the business: 
case deflection, chatbot containment, term usage for taxonomies, 
and the reduction of “how do I…?” support tickets.

For operations: 
writer focus time, throughput, review cycles, staleness patterns, 
and the ratio of writing vs non-writing work.

It’s important to emphasize that the goal isn’t for people to spend more time on docs. 
The goal is to make better decisions and deliver content that drives real behavior change.  
Evidence is what lets us continuously refine the lifecycle.

# Step 7  
## Start small

<!-- notes:
The safest and most effective way to modernize the lifecycle 
is to start small and scale intentionally.

We choose a low-effort, high-impact area — 
a part of the product where pain is clear and improvements are visible.

We apply the new intake, triage, prioritization, 
and operational workflows to this area.

We measure outcomes, gather feedback, and refine the model.

If the pilot is successful, 
stakeholders will naturally ask: “We want more of this — how do we get it?”

This approach reduces risk, builds trust, and helps the organization 
adopt the new lifecycle willingly, not reluctantly.

# Ideas worth exploring  
### *Examples, not prescriptions*

<!-- notes:
I want to close with a set of ideas worth exploring. 
These are not prescriptions — I don’t believe in proposing specific fixes 
before understanding the organizational reality in detail.
But these are the kinds of solutions that often unlock significant improvement.

• Templates and guidelines that eliminate ambiguity  
• Tooling and automation — linting, scripts, screenshot naming, DWK  
• Contribution workflows so PMs and engineers provide high-quality inputs  
• Governance loops: QA cycles, flow adherence, roadmap-driven deprecation  
• Case deflection mechanisms for support  
• Reuse strategies to avoid duplicating content  
• RAG-based authoring assistance to reduce inconsistencies  
• Automated Slack workflows to triage requests  
• Strong reporting dashboards

Think of this slide as a “palette,” not a prescription: 
ideas that can spark conversations once the lifecycle evaluation begins.

# Wait — what about AI?

<!-- notes:
Before closing, I want to address a question that often comes up: 
where does AI fit into all of this?

AI can enhance almost every part of the lifecycle: 
from automating formatting, to suggesting content, to detecting inconsistencies, 
to accelerating reviews, to powering chatbots and internal tools.

But AI cannot fix organizational and operational gaps.
If the processes are unclear, if the inputs are weak, if governance is missing, 
AI will simply scale the chaos.

Think of AI as an amplifier:
when the foundations are strong, AI accelerates us.  
When the foundations are weak, AI magnifies the pain.

That’s why everything I’ve presented focuses on building the foundations first.
Once those foundations exist, AI becomes a powerful multiplier — 
not a band-aid.
