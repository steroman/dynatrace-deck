## 🧹 Due diligence

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-4 mt-6 text-sm">

<div class="border rounded-2xl p-4 shadow">
✅ Solution requires a mix of change management, content operations, and product management
</div>

<div class="border rounded-2xl p-4 shadow">
✅ Openness to cross-functional collaboration
</div>

<div class="border rounded-2xl p-4 shadow">
✅ Leadership buy-in to treat documentation as a business asset, not a deliverable
</div>

<div class="border rounded-2xl p-4 shadow">
✅ Ability to influence processes and roadmap in teams involved in the solution
</div>

<div class="border rounded-2xl p-4 shadow">
✅ Team capacity to pilot and iterate before scaling across the organization
</div>

</div>

<!-- notes:

Ok so, before we dive deeper there's some due diligence to do. Here are the assumptions I have made along the way. So please start from them to frame the scope of this proposal. Should one not hold, any level can be adapted: from strategy to execution.

1. The strategy requires a mix of change management, content operations, and product management. In the real world, this would be handled by a larger team with cross-functional expertise.

## Opportunities

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-8 mt-6 text-base">

<div>
<h3>If we don't act</h3>
<v-clicks>

- 🧱 **Content debt grows** — too much to maintain, too little time  
- 💔 **User trust erodes** — outdated or inconsistent information breaks confidence  
- 💸 **Costs rise** — more support tickets, slower onboarding, less self-serve  

</v-clicks>
</div>

<div>
<h3>If we do act</h3>
<v-clicks>

- 🚀 **Knowledge becomes a growth engine**  
- 🤝 **Users self-serve confidently** through up-to-date, relevant content  
- 💡 **Docs drive activation and adoption**, amplifying business outcomes  

</v-clicks>

</div>

<!-- notes:
When introducing this slide, I’ll frame the idea as solving one of our biggest systemic gaps — the lack of shared awareness across teams that all produce user-facing content. 

Right now, each function — marketing, product marketing, documentation, support, sales, engineering — produces information in isolation. Everyone’s contributing to the story, but no one is orchestrating the full experience from the user’s point of view. 

So I plan on starting by creating a cross-functional team that brings together all these user-facing roles — not as a committee that meets for the sake of meetings, but as a working group that builds shared ownership of knowledge. The vision is collaboration as a means to shared responsibility: everyone who shapes information should understand what others need to serve users effectively.

This team’s mission is threefold. First, to define a standard set of content that must exist for every user journey — what needs to be produced, by whom, and at what stage. Second, to map those content pieces against the actual user journey, ensuring each deliverable moves users naturally from one step to the next. This includes thinking about the user’s emotional state, prior knowledge, and receptivity — not just where they are in the product, but how ready they are to absorb new information. 

Third, the team will own feedback loops: they’ll bring insights from their respective departments back into the group, share patterns, and experiment with improvements. It’s not a static council — it’s a lab for content innovation. The goal is to continually test and refine how our content performs, whether that’s by changing the format, timing, or even the purpose of a deliverable.

Over time, this team will also create awareness of what information needs to be produced earlier in the product lifecycle. That’s how we’ll shift knowledge left — identifying gaps before release, not after. They’ll influence definitions of ready and done, align content tiering, and eventually coordinate releases and shared metrics across teams.

To make this successful, I’ll start small. Leadership endorsement is key, but equally important is momentum — so I’ll pilot this with a smaller, less rigid product area where teams are open to experimentation. Once we show clear wins — better coordination, fresher content, fewer support escalations — we’ll expand. 

I’ll tell the story here about a time when a customer-facing team couldn’t find the right material during a product launch, leading to confusion and inconsistent messaging. Then I’ll describe how this cross-functional setup would have prevented that by ensuring everyone had visibility, earlier context, and a shared definition of “ready.” It makes the problem tangible and the solution obvious.

<!-- notes:
1. **Map Core Workflows**  
   - Partner with UX Research, Design, and Product to chart **core user workflows**.  
   - Cover stages from **awareness → advocacy → end of relationship**.  
   - Focus on **how users actually interact with content**, not hypothetical touchpoints.

2. **Define Deliverables per Stage and Release Tier**  
   - Identify the **content required** at each step of the journey.  
   - Decide with Product which deliverables are produced or maintained for each release tier:  
     - **Tier 1:** Full set of deliverables (PR, blog posts, newsletters, release notes, help center articles, changelog, troubleshooting guides, etc.)  
     - **Tier 2:** Essential subset of deliverables.

3. **Test Content in Context**  
   - Validate content **within the workflow**, not as stand-alone assets, to ensure relevance and usability.

4. **Assess Each Increment**  
   - Evaluate every new piece of content as a **delta from the current journey mapping**.  
   - This ensures continuous improvement and alignment with actual user needs.
