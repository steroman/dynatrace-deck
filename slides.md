Ok so, before we dive deeper there's some due diligence to do. Here are the assumptions I have made along the way. So please start from them to frame the scope of this proposal. Should one not hold, any level can be adapted: from strategy to execution.

The strategy requires a mix of change management, content operations, and product management. In the real world, this would be handled by a larger team with cross-functional expertise.

<!-- notes:
When introducing this slide, I’ll frame the idea as solving one of our biggest systemic gaps — the lack of shared awareness across teams that all produce user-facing content. 

Right now, each function — marketing, product marketing, documentation, support, sales, engineering — produces information in isolation. Everyone’s contributing to the story, but no one is orchestrating the full experience from the user’s point of view. 

So I plan on starting by creating a cross-functional team that brings together all these user-facing roles — not as a committee that meets for the sake of meetings, but as a working group that builds shared ownership of knowledge. The vision is collaboration as a means to shared responsibility: everyone who shapes information should understand what others need to serve users effectively.

This team’s mission is threefold. First, to define a standard set of content that must exist for every user journey — what needs to be produced, by whom, and at what stage. Second, to map those content pieces against the actual user journey, ensuring each deliverable moves users naturally from one step to the next. This includes thinking about the user’s emotional state, prior knowledge, and receptivity — not just where they are in the product, but how ready they are to absorb new information. 

Third, the team will own feedback loops: they’ll bring insights from their respective departments back into the group, share patterns, and experiment with improvements. It’s not a static council — it’s a lab for content innovation. The goal is to continually test and refine how our content performs, whether that’s by changing the format, timing, or even the purpose of a deliverable.

Over time, this team will also create awareness of what information needs to be produced earlier in the product lifecycle. That’s how we’ll shift knowledge left — identifying gaps before release, not after. They’ll influence definitions of ready and done, align content tiering, and eventually coordinate releases and shared metrics across teams.

To make this successful, I’ll start small. Leadership endorsement is key, but equally important is momentum — so I’ll pilot this with a smaller, less rigid product area where teams are open to experimentation. Once we show clear wins — better coordination, fresher content, fewer support escalations — we’ll expand. 

I’ll tell the story here about a time when a customer-facing team couldn’t find the right material during a product launch, leading to confusion and inconsistent messaging. Then I’ll describe how this cross-functional setup would have prevented that by ensuring everyone had visibility, earlier context, and a shared definition of “ready.” It makes the problem tangible and the solution obvious.

2. <strong>Define Deliverables per Stage and Release Tier</strong>  
   - Identify the <strong>content required</strong> at each step of the journey.  
   - Decide with Product which deliverables are produced or maintained for each release tier:  
     - <strong>Tier 1:</strong> Full set of deliverables (PR, blog posts, newsletters, release notes, help center articles, changelog, troubleshooting guides, etc.)  
     - <strong>Tier 2:</strong> Essential subset of deliverables.

3. <strong>Test Content in Context</strong>  
   - Validate content <strong>within the workflow</strong>, not as stand-alone assets, to ensure relevance and usability.

4. <strong>Assess Each Increment</strong>  
   - Evaluate every new piece of content as a <strong>delta from the current journey mapping</strong>.  
   - This ensures continuous improvement and alignment with actual user needs.

<!-- notes:
Traditional content teams often measure success through engagement and clarity. These matter, but if we stop there, we miss the real reason content exists: to influence behavior and drive business outcomes. Users don’t want to “engage” with content — they want answers, they want to solve problems, and they want to move on with their day. So we need to measure content in terms of what it helps them accomplish.

Once we have journey mapping in place, we can define clear behavioral goals for each stage. At awareness, users need to understand what a feature is and why it matters. At exploration, they need enough guidance to understand how it works. At activation, they need a clear path to success. And not every feature requires the same depth — and that’s fine. What matters is that we assess these stages systematically and build loops to learn and iterate.

On the user side, we measure things like activation time, task completion without support, and troubleshooting confidence. These tell us whether content is helping users perform the jobs-to-be-done and reduce friction.

On the business side, we focus on metrics like feature discovery and adoption uplift, and reductions in support tickets, especially “how do I…” questions. If the organization uses AI agents trained on the docs, we can also measure deflection or containment — essentially, whether the content is strong enough for the AI to answer without escalating to support.

Finally, on the operational side, we continue tracking how efficiently we work: time from roadmap changes to published content, review cycles, and how well teams follow content standards. These operational metrics help us identify friction and improve the content delivery system itself — something we’ll explore more in the next section.

<!--
When we talk about process, the goal isn’t bureaucracy — it’s scalability, predictability, and the ability to measure what matters. Standards don't only improve efficiency and consistency, but they also allow to measure deviations from them. A scalable process gives us that clarity.

There isn't one single “content process.” Instead, it’s a combination of systems working together.

The first system is automation: using journey mapping and content tiering to automatically identify what needs to be produced at each product increment. If something enters the roadmap or changes state, that should trigger content work. With the right metadata and forms around work items, writers should receive the information they need upfront rather than having to chase PMs and SMEs for context. This eliminates information-hunting and creates a predictable flow.

But the organic interactions matter too — hallway conversations, early signals from design reviews, Slack threads, support insights. These informal pathways reveal real user needs. A good governance model accounts for both the automated and the organic workstreams and provides tools to track them and turn them into actionable and measurable tasks.

Next, we think about content lifecycle. I prefer a “git-like” model: every change to the product creates a delta in content. That approach naturally reduces staleness because the content system mirrors the product system. I've seen teams rely on periodic staleness checks — for example, flagging articles that haven’t been touched in six months. That can work, but it often incentivizes quick edits rather than meaningful reevaluation. A delta-based model prevents this by design. You can even go further with ideas like docs-as-tests, where documentation is backed by automated end-to-end tests — if the tests fail, the content is outdated.

Ownership and accountability play a huge role. Writers need influence over the Definition of Ready and Definition of Done to make sure content requirements are baked into product milestones, not treated as an afterthought.

A scalable process also means considering all workstreams: reactive updates, roadmap-driven projects, experiments, maintenance, and innovation. And it means balancing day-to-day delivery with long-term strategic work.

Finally, process is how we turn north-star outcomes into actionable work. Whether you use OKRs, GIST, RICE, or an evidence-scoring model, the important thing is building a culture of experimentation and frequent reassessment. We should routinely evaluate how content performs: which articles are succeeding, which are failing, and why. This constant loop of evidence and iteration is how the system becomes self-improving.

The end goal isn’t a rigid workflow — it’s a living, adaptive system that mirrors the product, scales with the organization, and improves based on evidence.

</div>

</div>

<!-- notes:
Shifting content left is ultimately a culture change. The term comes from software testing, where teams started moving tests earlier in the development cycle to catch issues sooner, reduce costs, and improve quality. We're applying the same principle to knowledge work.

Everything we’ve talked about so far — cross-functional collaboration, journey mapping, behavior-based measurement, automation, governance — all of it adds up to shifting knowledge earlier in the lifecycle. When content is considered only at the end, we create churn, we create rework, and we limit our ability to influence the product experience. When content is considered from the beginning, it becomes part of how the product is designed, validated, and delivered.

Shifting left means that information needs are surfaced early, before development starts. It means that gathering inputs isn’t an ad-hoc scramble at the end, but a natural part of how teams collaborate. It means that contributors across product, design, engineering, and support understand the role they play in maintaining and evolving the knowledge base. Writers stop being information hunters and become strategic partners.

This shift only works when the system supports it: clear standards, repeatable templates, metadata that captures the right information, and tooling that makes it easy for anyone to contribute. When those pieces are in place, ownership becomes shared, content quality improves, and teams make better decisions because the narrative is present from the beginning.

So shifting content left isn’t a single initiative — it’s the natural outcome of building the right team, mapping the journey, measuring the right things, and creating a scalable, evidence-based process. It’s how content becomes a true part of the product, rather than an afterthought.

<!--
When we talk about next steps, the priority is to make this framework real in a way that’s simple, actionable, and low-friction.

The first step is to define success. Before we do anything, we align on what “good” looks like: the outcomes we want to drive, who owns what, and the metrics that will tell us whether we’re moving in the right direction. This gives everyone the same north star.

Next, we enable contributors. None of this works unless people feel equipped to participate. That means lightweight training, clear standards, and simple templates so teams know what’s expected and can contribute without friction. This is where the culture shift starts.

Then we run a small pilot — just one product area. We map one end-to-end user workflow, apply the tiering and governance model, and test how the process holds up in real life. The goal is not perfection, but learning.

To reinforce momentum, we make progress visible. A transparent metrics dashboard helps show early impact, build trust, and create advocates across teams.

Finally, after three months, we review results, refine the model, and scale. This approach keeps the scope controlled, the risk low, and the learning high — and it ensures that when we expand, we do it with confidence and evidence, not assumptions.

# Part 2  
## Modernizing the content lifecycle

<!-- notes:
In Task 1, we focused on rethinking documentation strategically. 
Here, we look at the operational backbone that makes that strategy actually work.
The reality today is that writers struggle to keep up with product velocity, and content becomes stale quickly.
That creates risk for users, support, and even LLM accuracy.
So in this section, I’ll walk you through a practical path for evaluating the current lifecycle, 
understanding where friction lives, and transitioning to a system that scales with the product.
-->

class: text-center

# Mission  
## Velocity and quality at scale

<!-- notes:
The mission behind modernizing the lifecycle is straightforward: 
we want to deliver velocity and quality at the same time, without burning out the team.
That means reducing friction so writers can spend most of their time actually writing, 
and ensuring that PMs and engineers know exactly what inputs the docs team needs and when.
A modern lifecycle gives us predictable flow, strong quality standards, 
and content that keeps up with the pace of change.
-->

layout: center
transition: fade
class: text-center

# Our operating assumptions

**Velocity =** less friction · better tooling · solid processes  
**Quality =** clarity · relevance · strong inputs  
**Scalability =** standards · automation · shared ownership  
**Sustainability =** balanced workloads · clear roles

<!-- notes:
These assumptions guide every decision in this lifecycle.
Velocity comes from removing friction and giving teams clear processes and tools.
Quality depends on clear inputs—writers can only deliver great content when they get the right context early.
Scalability comes from standardization and automation, not from heroics.
And sustainability is essential: if workloads or expectations aren’t balanced, the system collapses.
These assumptions shape the whole approach.

# What success looks like

> “Documentation is predictable, scalable, and aligned with business outcomes.”  
<small>— Leadership</small>

> “I finally spend most of my time writing.”  
<small>— Writer</small>

> “I know exactly what’s expected of me and how to contribute.”  
<small>— PM</small>

<!-- notes:
Success looks different for different people.
For leadership, it’s predictability and alignment with business goals.
For writers, it’s being able to focus on writing instead of chasing inputs or dealing with noise.
For PMs, it’s clarity: knowing exactly what’s expected and how to provide the right inputs.
These perspectives reflect the cultural and operational shift we want to create.

# The path forward

**1. Evaluate the system**  
**2. Audit scope**  
**3. Prioritize what matters**  
**4. Allocate time deliberately**  
**5. Strengthen operations**  
**6. Measure performance**  
**7. Start small**

<!-- notes:
These are the seven steps I’ll walk through.
They form a practical, realistic path toward a modern lifecycle—from evaluation, 
to clarity, to operational strength, to measurement, and finally to a safe, small-scale rollout.

# Step 1  
## Evaluate the system

<!-- notes:
Evaluating the system means understanding how work actually flows today.
I start with people: where writers lose time, what interrupts their focus, 
and how often they have to chase context instead of writing.
Then process: what the end-to-end workflow really looks like, 
how many workstreams compete for attention, and where handoffs break.
Then technology: where metadata, templates, or automation are missing and causing manual rework.
A key part of this step is centralizing all incoming work into a single board so we can see and prioritize it consistently.
Evaluating the system reveals where friction lives and where improvements will have the highest impact.
-->

# Step 2  
## Audit the scope

<!-- notes:
Auditing the scope means identifying what we actually produce and why.
We list content types, formats, and variants, and evaluate each one based on user value and business value.
Many organizations accumulate content that no longer serves a purpose or is duplicated in multiple places.
The audit helps us declutter, identify high-impact content areas, 
and ensure that what we maintain aligns with user needs and with the workflows defined in Task 1.
This step sets the stage for meaningful prioritization.

To focus the team’s efforts, I use a dual-track prioritization model.
For strategic improvements—revamps, experiments, new content types—I use evidence-based tools like 
North Star, OKRs, GIST, confidence scoring, and ICE. This ensures we invest time in ideas that have real impact.
For operational work—especially feature documentation—we rely on the tiering model from Task 1.
Tier 0 always gets delivered, Tier 1 usually does, and Tier 2 only if capacity allows.
This creates clarity for writers and PMs and helps everyone understand why some work moves forward and some doesn’t.

# Step 4  
## Allocate time deliberately

<!-- notes:
Balancing feature documentation, revamps, and experimentation requires intentional planning.
Writers benefit from learning to estimate work realistically, and retros help improve those estimates over time.
We protect experimentation time by defining quotas so that innovation doesn’t get pushed aside by day-to-day delivery.
Leadership alignment is key—PMs and engineers should understand that experimentation isn’t optional; it’s what improves the system long-term.
Training contributors on workflows and templates also reduces friction and speeds up delivery.

# Step 5  
## Strengthen operations

<!-- notes:
Operational rigor is what makes a lifecycle scalable.
We start with clear guidelines and templates so writers don’t have to reinvent structure or terminology.
We expand content reuse where it makes sense, reducing maintenance effort.
We invest in tooling: automated linting, scripts, standardized naming, and snippet libraries that speed up writing.
Contribution guidelines help PMs and engineers provide inputs that are complete and consistent.
Governance ties everything together: routine QA, adherence checks, and roadmap-driven deprecation to prevent staleness.
Strengthening operations reduces rework and creates a healthier, more predictable content system.

# Step 6  
## Measure performance

<!-- notes:
A modern lifecycle relies on evidence, not guesswork.
We look at users: task completion, onboarding friction, and how well content helps them move through workflows.
We look at business outcomes like case deflection and feature adoption.
And we look at operations: writer focus time, review cycles, and overall throughput.
Measuring across these three lenses helps us decide what to improve, what to retire, 
and where to invest next so the system keeps evolving in the right direction.

# Step 7  
## Start small

<!-- notes:
We introduce change safely by starting small.
We pick a low-effort, high-impact part of the product and apply the new intake, prioritization, and operational foundations to it.
We measure results, gather feedback, and refine the model before expanding it.
A good pilot creates pull rather than push—teams see the improvement and want the same clarity and consistency.
This approach builds trust and minimizes risk during the transition.

# Ideas worth exploring  
### *Examples, not prescriptions*

<!-- notes:
I want to close with a set of ideas worth exploring once the foundations are in place.
These are not prescriptions, because solutions only work when they fit the organization.
But here are areas that often unlock value:
improved templates and guidelines, automation through linting or scripts,
better contribution workflows, stronger governance loops, case deflection mechanisms, 
content reuse strategies, and RAG-based authoring assistance to improve consistency.
These ideas can spark future conversations after the lifecycle evaluation begins.

# Wait — what about AI?

<!-- notes:
AI plays a role across every part of the lifecycle, but it can’t replace the foundations.
AI can accelerate formatting, improve suggestions, detect inconsistencies, 
and power internal tools or chatbots.
But if processes are unclear, inputs weak, or governance missing, 
AI will simply amplify the chaos rather than solve it.
That’s why we focus on building strong processes first.
Once those are in place, AI becomes a powerful multiplier that makes teams faster and more accurate.

*(QR code placeholder)*

<!-- notes:
Thank you for the time and attention.
Here I’ll add a QR code linking to my LinkedIn.
Some of the influences behind this approach include evidence-based prioritization frameworks, 
modern documentation tooling, and collaborative models for treating docs as a product.
Happy to share any of these references afterward.
