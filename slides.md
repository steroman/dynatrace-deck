<!-- notes:
When introducing this slide, I’ll frame the idea as solving one of our biggest systemic gaps — the lack of shared awareness across teams that all produce user-facing content. 

Right now, each function — marketing, product marketing, documentation, support, sales, engineering — produces information in isolation. Everyone’s contributing to the story, but no one is orchestrating the full experience from the user’s point of view. 

So I plan on starting by creating a cross-functional team that brings together all these user-facing roles — not as a committee that meets for the sake of meetings, but as a working group that builds shared ownership of knowledge. The vision is collaboration as a means to shared responsibility: everyone who shapes information should understand what others need to serve users effectively.

This team’s mission is threefold. First, to define a standard set of content that must exist for every user journey — what needs to be produced, by whom, and at what stage. Second, to map those content pieces against the actual user journey, ensuring each deliverable moves users naturally from one step to the next. This includes thinking about the user’s emotional state, prior knowledge, and receptivity — not just where they are in the product, but how ready they are to absorb new information. 

Third, the team will own feedback loops: they’ll bring insights from their respective departments back into the group, share patterns, and experiment with improvements. It’s not a static council — it’s a lab for content innovation. The goal is to continually test and refine how our content performs, whether that’s by changing the format, timing, or even the purpose of a deliverable.

Over time, this team will also create awareness of what information needs to be produced earlier in the product lifecycle. That’s how we’ll shift knowledge left — identifying gaps before release, not after. They’ll influence definitions of ready and done, align content tiering, and eventually coordinate releases and shared metrics across teams.

To make this successful, I’ll start small. Leadership endorsement is key, but equally important is momentum — so I’ll pilot this with a smaller, less rigid product area where teams are open to experimentation. Once we show clear wins — better coordination, fresher content, fewer support escalations — we’ll expand. 

I’ll tell the story here about a time when a customer-facing team couldn’t find the right material during a product launch, leading to confusion and inconsistent messaging. Then I’ll describe how this cross-functional setup would have prevented that by ensuring everyone had visibility, earlier context, and a shared definition of “ready.” It makes the problem tangible and the solution obvious.

2. **Define Deliverables per Stage and Release Tier**  
   - Identify the **content required** at each step of the journey.  
   - Decide with Product which deliverables are produced or maintained for each release tier:  
     - **Tier 1:** Full set of deliverables (PR, blog posts, newsletters, release notes, help center articles, changelog, troubleshooting guides, etc.)  
     - **Tier 2:** Essential subset of deliverables.

3. **Test Content in Context**  
   - Validate content **within the workflow**, not as stand-alone assets, to ensure relevance and usability.

4. **Assess Each Increment**  
   - Evaluate every new piece of content as a **delta from the current journey mapping**.  
   - This ensures continuous improvement and alignment with actual user needs.

<!-- notes:
Traditional content teams often measure success through engagement and clarity. These matter, but if we stop there, we miss the real reason content exists: to influence behavior and drive business outcomes. Users don’t want to “engage” with content — they want answers, they want to solve problems, and they want to move on with their day. So we need to measure content in terms of what it helps them accomplish.

Once we have journey mapping in place, we can define clear behavioral goals for each stage. At awareness, users need to understand what a feature is and why it matters. At exploration, they need enough guidance to understand how it works. At activation, they need a clear path to success. And not every feature requires the same depth — and that’s fine. What matters is that we assess these stages systematically and build loops to learn and iterate.

On the user side, we measure things like activation time, task completion without support, and troubleshooting confidence. These tell us whether content is helping users perform the jobs-to-be-done and reduce friction.

On the business side, we focus on metrics like feature discovery and adoption uplift, and reductions in support tickets, especially “how do I…” questions. If the organization uses AI agents trained on the docs, we can also measure deflection or containment — essentially, whether the content is strong enough for the AI to answer without escalating to support.

Finally, on the operational side, we continue tracking how efficiently we work: time from roadmap changes to published content, review cycles, and how well teams follow content standards. These operational metrics help us identify friction and improve the content delivery system itself — something we’ll explore more in the next section.

<!--
When we talk about process, the goal isn’t bureaucracy — it’s scalability, predictability, and the ability to measure what matters. Standards don't only improve efficiency and consistency, but they also allow to measure deviations from them. A scalable process gives us that clarity.

There isn't one single “content process.” Instead, it’s a combination of systems working together.

The first system is automation: using journey mapping and content tiering to automatically identify what needs to be produced at each product increment. If something enters the roadmap or changes state, that should trigger content work. With the right metadata and forms around work items, writers should receive the information they need upfront rather than having to chase PMs and SMEs for context. This eliminates information-hunting and creates a predictable flow.

But the organic interactions matter too — hallway conversations, early signals from design reviews, Slack threads, support insights. These informal pathways reveal real user needs. A good governance model accounts for both the automated and the organic workstreams and provides tools to track them and turn them into actionable and measurable tasks.

Next, we think about content lifecycle. I prefer a “git-like” model: every change to the product creates a delta in content. That approach naturally reduces staleness because the content system mirrors the product system. I've seen teams rely on periodic staleness checks — for example, flagging articles that haven’t been touched in six months. That can work, but it often incentivizes quick edits rather than meaningful reevaluation. A delta-based model prevents this by design. You can even go further with ideas like docs-as-tests, where documentation is backed by automated end-to-end tests — if the tests fail, the content is outdated.

Ownership and accountability play a huge role. Writers need influence over the Definition of Ready and Definition of Done to make sure content requirements are baked into product milestones, not treated as an afterthought.

A scalable process also means considering all workstreams: reactive updates, roadmap-driven projects, experiments, maintenance, and innovation. And it means balancing day-to-day delivery with long-term strategic work.

Finally, process is how we turn north-star outcomes into actionable work. Whether you use OKRs, GIST, RICE, or an evidence-scoring model, the important thing is building a culture of experimentation and frequent reassessment. We should routinely evaluate how content performs: which articles are succeeding, which are failing, and why. This constant loop of evidence and iteration is how the system becomes self-improving.

The end goal isn’t a rigid workflow — it’s a living, adaptive system that mirrors the product, scales with the organization, and improves based on evidence.

</div>

</div>

<!-- notes:
Shifting content left is ultimately a culture change. The term comes from software testing, where teams started moving tests earlier in the development cycle to catch issues sooner, reduce costs, and improve quality. We're applying the same principle to knowledge work.

Everything we’ve talked about so far — cross-functional collaboration, journey mapping, behavior-based measurement, automation, governance — all of it adds up to shifting knowledge earlier in the lifecycle. When content is considered only at the end, we create churn, we create rework, and we limit our ability to influence the product experience. When content is considered from the beginning, it becomes part of how the product is designed, validated, and delivered.

Shifting left means that information needs are surfaced early, before development starts. It means that gathering inputs isn’t an ad-hoc scramble at the end, but a natural part of how teams collaborate. It means that contributors across product, design, engineering, and support understand the role they play in maintaining and evolving the knowledge base. Writers stop being information hunters and become strategic partners.

This shift only works when the system supports it: clear standards, repeatable templates, metadata that captures the right information, and tooling that makes it easy for anyone to contribute. When those pieces are in place, ownership becomes shared, content quality improves, and teams make better decisions because the narrative is present from the beginning.

So shifting content left isn’t a single initiative — it’s the natural outcome of building the right team, mapping the journey, measuring the right things, and creating a scalable, evidence-based process. It’s how content becomes a true part of the product, rather than an afterthought.
