Let's first work on the notes for this slide, because it's going a bit offtopic and I want to stir it back.

Among its first actions, the commitee would partner with UX Research, Design, and Product to create journey mappings of the core workflows and going from awareness to advocacy and even end of relationship. Then it will identify the content deliverables at each step and define, together with product, what deliverables are to be produced or maintained for each release tier. For example, Tier 1 releases will get fully-fledged deliverables including PR, blog post, newsletter, release notes, help center articles, changelog, troubleshooting guide, etc, while Tier 2 gets less

The goal of the mapping is to surface how users get in contact and interact with the content in real life, not in a vacuum.

The idea is that every increment is also assessed as a delta to the current status quo described by the mapping.
